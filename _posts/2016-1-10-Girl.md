I met with this girl last night. She looked absolutely beautiful, the way you can only mirror in a poem. The kind of person you look at and you just go "Aww! Wow!". The kind of person you can't describe without a form of art. Sitting next to her felt like bathing in a pool of sunlight. Talking to her felt like thinking. We talked talked talked talked and stumbled through the cold night surrendering to our sensations. Listening to music, waiting for a bus, I didn't know how I started kissing her. Running towards her home, holding hands, feeling like Allen Ginsberg and Neal Cassady in 1950s New York. Staggering into her flat we fell on the bed. Lying there, our bodies unified, a feeling of returning to nothingness rushed over me. She's perfect, but I was not myself and fucked it up. It all shouldn't happen again, but it was what I needed to be here now and write this down with finally a smile on my face.
