Breathe, breathe, flowing world.
Everything’s moving, never still.
It is, it’s moving. When it isn’t moving, it is not.
Death and life. Reality and illusion.
You can’t know one without knowing the other.
We think we know, we don’t. We don’t think, we know.
Everything is flowing, flowing with the Tao.
You can’t change the Tao. Change would be Tao.
Try to set yourself apart of the Tao? It would be a part of it.

No time, all at once. No matter, all empty.
My thoughts, my eyes, my brain. They create the world.
My my my my, oh my! What is I?
What’s part of it, what isn’t?
Where do I end, where do I start?
I am everything, I am nothing.
There is no start, there is no end.
All is flowing. All is all.
All is perfectly working together. All is flowing in itself.

The visions, oh the visions. Are they real?
The world, oh the world. Is it real?
What is the difference, what is real?
We create real. The vision is as real as the world.
Created by me. Me again.

No me! No difference! All one! All it! Words words words words. All just words.

Da Da Da Da.
The wise man makes no difference.
The wise man draws no line.
Da Da Da Da.
