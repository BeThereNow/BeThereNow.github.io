title: Desiring Death
---

All I ever wanted was to return. Return to where I came from, return to nothingness, return to the void. Used to take drugs to do so, the comedown bringing me back into the world I never understood. Now meditating, it helps, but I'm still not satisfied. The invisible desire, oh the invisible desire. It's burning through me, killing everything inside. I can't do this any longer, I can't stay here. I have to run, I have to go. Maybe death is returning to the void, my only hope. Maybe death is satisfaction, desiring death.
