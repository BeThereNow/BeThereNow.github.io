title: Go With The Tao
---

There is a Taoist story that goes something like this:

>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. All the neighbors came around to commemorate that evening, “So sorry that your horse has run away, that’s too bad.” and he said, “Maybe.”

>The next day the horse came back, bringing seven wild horses with it. Everyone came around in the evening and said, “Oh isn’t that lucky, what a great turn of events, you’ve now got eight horses.” and he said, “Maybe.”

>The next day his son tried to break one of the horses and ride it, but was thrown and ended up breaking his leg. They all said, “Oh dear that’s too bad.” and he said, “Maybe.”

>The following day the conscription officers came around to recruit, or to force people into the army but they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. All the people came around and said, “That’s great.” and he said, “Maybe.”

The farmer is aware of what in eastern spirituality is called ‚Tao’, the flow of events, the ways things are, the way of the universe. Going with the Tao is to just accept things and events as they are. It sounds easier than it is and requires a special mindset which one has to achieve.

There is no point in not-going with the Tao, because you can’t change what has already happened and you do not know the future outcome of it. But rejecting and overthinking a past event will only cause suffering. Of course one might say, "But if I’m suffering for it, the suffering might turn out to be good for something.". Yes it might be. It would just be the Tao again, everything is the Tao. It is impossible to ignore the Tao, because ignoring it would be part of the Tao again. But it is our human nature to avoid suffering, and to desire happiness. Therefore we should just go with it and give up on the past.

In Buddhism the past and the future are seen as a hallucinations of the brain, they are only in our mind and do not exist. The past is unchangeable and the future is uncertain. It is therefore of the greatest importance to live in the present moment, the only reality. If you can't fully live in the presence, you are just living a fantasy.
